############### test code to work with python's rpy package  ################
#############################################################################

#R packages are not the only way to distribute code. From this authorâ€™s experience there exists R code circulating as .R files.

#This is most likely not a good thing, but as a Python developers this also what you might be given with the task to implement an application 
#(such a web service) around that code. 
#In most working places you will not have the option to refuse the code until it is packaged; 
#fortunately rpy2 is trying to make this situation as simple as possible.
